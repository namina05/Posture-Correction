\# Posture Correction using MediaPipe



A real-time posture analysis module built using MediaPipe Holistic and OpenCV.



\## 📌 Overview

This project calculates shoulder alignment angles using pose landmarks and provides live posture feedback ("GOOD POSTURE" / "BAD POSTURE") based on biomechanical thresholds.



\## 🧠 How It Works

\- Uses MediaPipe Holistic for pose detection

\- Extracts shoulder, hip, and ear landmarks

\- Computes the angle at the shoulder joint

\- Displays posture feedback in real time



\## ⚙️ Technologies Used

\- Python

\- OpenCV

\- MediaPipe

\- NumPy



\## 🚀 Features

\- Real-time pose detection

\- Shoulder angle calculation

\- Live visual feedback

\- Modular posture logic (posture.py)
